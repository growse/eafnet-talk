                * Hi everyone
                * My name is etc. Full-time opinion-haver, full-time parent, part-time tinkerer.
                * Going to talk about a silly idea, what would it mean to self-host on *my* IP address
                * You can already buy and "own" a domain name, so why can't you buy and "own" some IP addresses?
                * Disclaimer for people who know things, I'm going to be over-simplifying some bits for clarity

                * Quick refresher course on IP
                * Numbering scheme for nodes in a network.
                * A network is a collection of things that are connected together somehow
                * give every node a unique number, or address.
                * Postal address analogy. Give everything a unique address, and then you can send stuff to places
                * So what does an IP address look like?

                * Another address
                * Simple scheme, give everything a number
                * Computers like numbers, especially fixed-width. Bad at variable width.
                * We decided IPs should be 128-bits
                * Old, experimental version of the internet that uses 32
                * 128 gives us a lot. How many?

                universe
                * Each address just 16 bytes.

                * Put a colon between each group
                * Idea is that you read from less specific to more, left-to-right
